# Intro to Machine Learning
This will cover some of the basics in machine learning (regression + cost functions + gradient descent). This is a work in progress still.

## Introduction

With the recent growth in popularity of LLMs, machine learning has become a term familiar to many. Machine learning is currently being utilized to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, financial services, and robotics. The definition of machine learning based on Wikipedia is:

"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions."

However, this doens't make it very clear. This is the first part of series where I aim to make machine learning accesible to anyone who cares to learn. 

## What is Machine Learning?

To start off simply machine learning can just be viewed as regression or drawing lines. 

1. Classification

Let's say you're a robot with a large collection of puppy photos and you want classify wether the dog is german shepherd or a golden retriever. The first step for machine learning algorithms is to obtain labeled training data. So, you want as many images you can find of german shepherds and golden retrievers labeled with their breeds, that we aim to classify. Utilizing these images, we can extract various features such as the ears, fur color, etc to see how they correlate to both breeds. For example, when we graph our labeled data it may look like this:
